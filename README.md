# Predicting-AstraZeneca-Stock-Movement

This project aims to predict stock movement of AstraZeneca (AZN) using historical data obtained from Yahoo Finance. Three machine learning models, long short-term memory (LSTM), K-Nearest Neighbors and linear regression, will be compared. The research questions of interest are: 

* Can a long short-term memory (LSTM) model accurately predict the future stock prices?
* Which of the three models best predicts future stock prices?
